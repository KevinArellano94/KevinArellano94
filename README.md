If you are still reading this, thank you!  I'll share some secrets about me:

**Currently working on:** GitHub's profile README.md file and Go projects. XD

**I’m currently learning:** Learning Go, Kotlin and Swift development.
 
**I’m looking to collaborate on:** AI, Machine Learning and Penetration testing certification.

**Ask me about:** Anything from software engineering, black holes to music.

**Fun facts:**
- I was born on January 1st.

- Minimalistc philomathic INTJ.

- If a computer had every characteristics and composure as a human brain, would it think it's human?  What's the difference or line that states reality versus simulation?  What is human?
 
- "The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma." - Patrick Star

- Currently working as a Software Engineer.

- "Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad." XD

- My favorite music genre is Post Rock, Post Metal, Atmostpheric Depressive Metal, Symphonic Metal and Dark Melodic.

- "Music is the hidden arithmetical exercise of a soul unconscious that it is calculating" - Leibniz

- "Music was invented to confirm human loneliness" - Durrell, Lawrence
- I appreciate kindness, understanding and complete unfiltered raw honesty.
- Did you know, there are more dead people than living people in the world?  Ratio is one thirtieth which means if you find a someone that is interesting, the timeline/place/location have to be exact!  So it's one out of 150+ billion!

Most favorite bands:
